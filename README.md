# About Cozy Homey

Side note: This repository is meant for study purposes for the minor web development offered at The Hogeschool van Amsterdam also known as University of Applied Sciences. If you're not a teacher or a fellow student, then it's probably not that interesting to look at this repository.

Cozy Homey is a cozy little house in the middle of nowhere, which you can partly interact with. You can experience Cozy Homey during the day (day mode) and during the night (dark mode). It's typically day once you hover over the platform and it's night when your cursor is off the platform.
